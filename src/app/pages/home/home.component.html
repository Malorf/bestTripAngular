              <span> Paragraph </span> I will be the leader of a company that
              ends up being worth billions of dollars, because I got the
              answers. I understand culture. I am the nucleus. I think thatâs a
              responsibility that I have, to push possibilities, to show people,
              this is the level that things could be at.
